# Continuity

**Continuity** is a Python package for *learning function operators with neural
networks*.

This package is based on PyTorch and provides a general interface for machine
learning on functions operators. It implements various neural network
architectures, including DeepONets or neural operators, physics-informed loss
functions to train the networks based on PDEs, and a variety of benchmarks.
