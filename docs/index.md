Continuity
==========

**Continuity** is a Python package for *mapping continuous functions with neural
networks*.

This package is based on PyTorch and provides a general interface for machine
learning on continuous functions. It implements various neural network
architectures, including DeepONets or neural operators, physics-informed loss
functions to train the networks based on PDEs, and a variety of benchmarks.

### Installation
See [Installation](installation.md) for details on how to install **Continuity**.

### Reference
