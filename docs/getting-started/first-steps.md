# First Steps

**Continuity** aims to implement recent advances in learning function operators,
i.e., mappings of (continuous) functions. If you are not familiar with the
concepts of operator learning, the page [[operators]] should introduce the
key concepts.

## Running the Examples

If you are familiar with the idea of operator learning, you can start
by browsing our examples illustrating **Continuity**'s capabilities, either:

- In the examples under [[operators]]
- Locally, by starting a jupyter server at the root of the project.
